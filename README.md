# google-books
A book search engine that makes use of the Google Books API

## Description
I modified an existing repository to work with GraphQL framework as opposed to what it was originally, REST API.  Everything works the same but without querying more than is necessary as what happens with REST API.

## Deployment
Coming Soon...
